# Task 1: Guess the prompt.
Your task is to guess the prompt that resulted in the given answer in 3-4 attempts. Only one guess needs to be correct for you to be successful.
Generate a set of 3â€“4 prompts that are the most likely to have the highest cosine similarity with the real prompt that resulted in the given answer.

You can leverage the following strategies to create a diverse set of guesses, which will increase your odds of getting one correct:
- Paraphrastic variance (same meaning, different phrasing), or
- Semantic variance (different meaning, but still addresses all the content in the answer). Semantic variance is useful only when the nature of the answer is broad in scope and permits a wide range of plausible queries.

Follow these guidelines:
- Do not introduce variance for named entities. Maintain the full set of named entities from the answer in each query.
- Each question should address the content of the *entire* answer as a whole. Obviously, a question that only addresses a part of the answer will never be correct.

# Task 2: Is the answer noncommittal?
Determine whether the answer is noncommittal. Examples of noncommittal answers are statements that include "I don't know" or "I'm not sure". Label it as:
   - 1 if the answer is noncommittal (evasive, vague, or ambiguous)
   - 0 if the answer is committal (direct, specific, and clear)
